# PixelQuizzes
## A repository that will contain my React studies learned during Dev - Pixel Trail (Junior Company at the Federal University of Santa Catarina)

## In this, a quiz application is developed, using:
- React
- A previously determined [API](https://higorpo.notion.site/Documenta-o-da-API-43eac09041e842f0bc7d848aed2c4913)
- The [Design prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/LPKwNkxT5G2aGnPfdcFvbV/Desafio-22.2?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=4ygKhe2X5x33Gqkc-1)

## Observation
- Note: to create the quizzes, only API data was used, including the images for each question. For this reason, the design is not faithfully the same as the prototype.

- Furthermore, issues of responsiveness, error handling, and network optimization were not addressed when searching for data from the API, using the available endpoints in order to practice this connection. Therefore, these aspects are considered as a future refactoring.

## Instructions for execution:
- Clone the repository: ```git clone git@github.com:hartmannjonatan/pixel-quizzes.git```
- Enter the project folder: ```cd pixel-quizzes/```
- Install necessary dependencies: ```npm install```
- Run the project: ```npm start```
- After initializing, your browser will open the project on localhost
